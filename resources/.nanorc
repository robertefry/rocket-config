## Sample initialization file for GNU nano.
##
## For the options that take parameters, the default value is shown.
## Other options are unset by default.  To make sure that an option
## is disabled, you can use "unset <option>".
##
## Characters that are special in a shell should not be escaped here.
## Inside string parameters, quotes should not be escaped -- the last
## double quote on the line will be seen as the closing quote.

## Make 'nextword' (Ctrl+Right) and 'chopwordright' (Ctrl+Delete)
## stop at word ends instead of at beginnings.
set afterends

## When soft line wrapping is enabled, make it wrap lines at blanks
## (tabs and spaces) instead of always at the edge of the screen.
set atblanks

## Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of
## tabs and/or spaces as the preceding line -- or as the next line
## if the preceding line is the beginning of a paragraph.
set autoindent

## Back up files to the current filename plus a tilde.
# set backup

## The directory to put unique backup files in.
# set backupdir ""

# set casesensitive

## Interpret digits given on the command line after a colon after a filename
## as the line number to go to in that file.
set colonparsing

## Do not use the line below the title bar, leaving it entirely blank.
# set emptyline

## Set the target width for automatic hard-wrapping and for justifying
## paragraphs.  If the specified value is 0 or less, the wrapping point
## will be the terminal's width minus this number.
set fill 80

## Draw a vertical stripe at the given column, to help judge text width.
## (This option does not have a default value.)
# set guidestripe 75

## Remember the used search/replace strings for the next session.

set indicator

## Scroll the buffer contents per half-screen instead of per line.
# set jumpyscrolling

## Display line numbers to the left (and any anchors in the margin).
set linenumbers

## Enable vim-style lock-files.  This is just to let a vim user know you
## are editing a file [s]he is trying to edit and vice versa.  There are
## no plans to implement vim-style undo state in these files.
set locking

## Fall back to slow libmagic to try and determine an applicable syntax.
# set magic

## search.  This may not contain blank characters.  The opening brackets

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with

## X Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
set mouse

## Don't convert files from DOS/Mac format.
set noconvert

## Don't automatically add a newline when a file does not end with one.
# set nonewlines

## Set operating directory.  nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so any files are inserted from this dir.  A blank
## string means the operating-directory feature is turned off.
# set operatingdir ""

## Remember the cursor position in each file for the next editing session.
# set positionlog

## The characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying paragraphs.
## This may not contain blank characters.  Only these closing punctuations,
## optionally followed by closing brackets, can end sentences.
set punct "!.?"

## Make status-bar messages disappear after 1 keystroke instead of after 20.
set quickblank

## The regular expression that matches quoting characters in email

# set rawsequences

## Fix Backspace/Delete confusion problem.

## Do regular-expression searches by default.
## Regular expressions are of the extended type (ERE).
set regexp

## Save a changed buffer automatically on exit; don't prompt.
# set saveonexit

## Make the Home key smarter: when Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true start
## of the line (the left edge).

## Spread overlong lines over multiple screen lines.
set softwrap

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not have a default value.

## M = mark, L = hard-wrapping long lines, R = recording, S = soft-wrapping.
set stateflags

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.

set tabstospaces

## Snip whitespace at the end of lines when justifying or hard-wrapping.
